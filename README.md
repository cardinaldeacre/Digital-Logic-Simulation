# 🔌 Digital Logic Simulation Project

This repository contains a collection of digital logic circuit simulations built using **Digital Works**, a tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project demonstrates basic to intermediate logic circuit designs, simulating how digital systems operate at the logic gate level. It includes various components commonly found in computer architecture and embedded systems.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Software:** [Digital Works](https://www.cburch.com/logisim/) (or the specific Digital Works version you used)
- **File Format:** `.dws` or similar
- **Platform:** Windows

## 📁 Included Simulations

- ✅ Basic Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- 🔁 Flip-Flops and Latches
- ⏱️ Clocks and Counters
- 🔢 Multiplexers and Demultiplexers
- 🧮 Adders and Subtractors
- 🖥️ Simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) components
- 💾 Register & Memory Simulations (optional, if included)

## 🎯 Objectives

- To understand how digital logic circuits work
- To simulate common components of digital systems
- To apply knowledge of digital logic design in practice
